  dialogue: "Finally! You\u2019ve managed to catch me! \nI\u2019ve been following
    you for a while - \never since you arrived at this lake \n- but I was too shy
    to come and talk to you, \nbut you finally approached me! \nOh, where are my manners?
    \nMy name is Adria! \nNice to meet you! \nSo forthcoming with your approach, \nAnd
    yet so shy face to face. \nIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve never talked to a
    fish. \nHm, we need a way to break the ice. \nOh, I know! \nI like you. \nSo\u2026
    \nHow about a date? \nWell, it\u2019s not good to keep a lady waiting. \nWhat
    do you say? \n"
